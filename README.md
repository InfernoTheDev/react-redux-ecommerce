3. _OPTIONAL_: Set up your custom domain with Google [here](https://gsuite.google.com/solutions/new-business/) _(this will enable sending emails from `whatever@yourdomain.com`)_.
4. Enable `Less Secure Apps` on the Gmail account you will be using _(this is needed to run Nodemailer with Gmail)_

```
STRIPE_TEST_PK= <YOUR STRIPE TEST PUBLIC KEY>
STRIPE_TEST_SK= <YOUR STRIPE TEST SECRET KEY>

STRIPE_LIVE_PK= <YOUR STRIPE LIVE PUBLIC KEY>

_NOTE: The `ADMIN_KEY` variable can be whatever you'd like, although a long alpha numeric key is recommended._

6. Customize the `config.json` file at the root of the repository to your liking.
7. Grab a beer and make some money üçªüíµ

### Handling Inventory

#### Adding Inventory

To add inventory to your store, make a post request to the `/api/inventory` api endpoint. View an example of the request body below:

**This is an admin restricted route, so you must pass in the admin key you created as the `Authorization` header.**

```
{
    "name": "Super Rad React Shirt",
    "desc": "A cool, super rad React shirt with an ulta cool description.",
    "image": "https://reactjs.org/static/react-50k-tshirt-dd4bfca3eacb85dc3c81fe91fb2e1c10-a6b71.jpg",
    "price": "1995"
}

```

_NOTE: Price is listed in units of $0.01, so 1995 = $19.95_

#### Updating Inventory

To update inventory, make a put request to `/api/inventory/:itemId` api endpoint. View an example of the request body below:

**This is an admin restricted route, so you must pass in the admin key you created as the `Authorization` header.**

{
    "price": "2599"
